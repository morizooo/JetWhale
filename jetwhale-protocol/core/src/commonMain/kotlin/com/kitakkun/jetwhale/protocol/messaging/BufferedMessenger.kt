/**
 * A connection-independent [JetWhaleMessenger] that outlives any single connection. Plugin code holds
 * one of these for its whole lifetime and the runtime [bind]s/[unbind]s the live transport (a peer's
 * messenger) underneath as connections come and go.
 *
 * Its reason to exist is the [OfflineSendPolicy.QUEUE] path: events sent while no transport is bound
 * are held in a **bounded, drop-oldest** buffer and flushed, in arrival order, once a transport is
 * bound *and* flushing has been opened with [startFlush]. The gate lets the runtime run a plugin's
 * connection-time initialization (which may [request] the other side) before buffered events start
 * flowing. [OfflineSendPolicy.DROP] and [OfflineSendPolicy.FAIL] sends and all requests go straight to
 * the live transport (or are dropped / fail / throw when there is none) — they are never buffered or
 * gated, so initialization can request() freely.
 *
 * Concurrency: sends arrive from arbitrary app threads while [bind]/[unbind] run on the runtime's
 * messaging coroutine. The live reference is a [MutableStateFlow] (atomic reads) and the offline
 * buffer is a single [Channel] drained by one consumer, so queued events keep a single FIFO order
 * without a lock. (Cross-policy ordering is not guaranteed: a [DROP]/[FAIL] send may overtake queued
 * events still draining. Use one policy per event stream if order matters.)
 *
 * @param bufferCapacity max number of offline events to retain; `0` disables buffering (QUEUE then
 *   behaves like [trySend]).
