/**
 * The single wire envelope for plugin messaging, in both directions (host -> agent and
 * agent -> host). Request/response is not a separate channel: a [Request] is just a one-way frame
 * carrying a [Request.correlationId], and a [Reply] is a one-way frame answering it via
 * [Reply.inReplyTo]. The sealed shape makes invalid states (a notification with a correlation id,
 * a reply carrying both payload and error, ...) unrepresentable.
 *
 * [Notification.messageType] / [Request.messageType] identify the concrete payload type (the
 * serial name captured at handler-registration / send time). A [Reply] needs no message type: the
 * requester already knows the expected reply type from the request's [JetWhaleRequest] declaration.
